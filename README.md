# Antitheft-System-using-IOT
An IOT based Anti-Theft System for Automotive Vehicles

It was a part of a B.Tech final year project by our team of two members, Aosenba Longchar and Milong Walling, both 
from Computer Science and Engineering Department under the guidance of Dr. Sibesh Lodh, Assitant Professor , 
NIT Nagaland.

The System consist of an independent Theft Detection and Tracking device which can be mounted in any type of automotive vehicle. 
It has the capability to detect any kind of consistent movement of the vehicle which then triggers an alarm 
when the movement exceeds a certain threshold value. The threshold value is maintain to avoid  false alarms 
which may be caused due to any kind of slight unintentional movement. The alarm is transmitted to the owner's
mobile phone where he can access the details of his vehicle  throug an app where he'll be able to detect the 
current location of his vehicle thus enabling him to monitor his vehicle in real-time.
